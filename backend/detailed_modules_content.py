        "concept_explanation": """Trauma is not defined by the event itself, but by how the nervous system responds to the event. When an individual experiences something overwhelming, the brain may fail to process the experience properly, leading to stored emotional and physiological responses.

There are three primary types of trauma:
• Acute Trauma: Resulting from a single distressing event (e.g., accident)
• Chronic Trauma: Repeated exposure (e.g., ongoing stress or abuse)
• Complex Trauma: Deep, layered trauma often from early life experiences""",
        "instructor_script": "Trauma is not what happens to you — it's what happens inside you as a result of what happened. Two people can go through the same event, and only one may develop trauma.",

• Sympathetic: Fight or Flight (activation)
• Parasympathetic: Rest and Digest (calm state)

When trauma occurs, the system may get stuck in activation or shutdown. Understanding nervous system regulation is key to emotional transformation.""",
